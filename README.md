- For example:
  ```
  <suite name="My suite" parallel="classes" thread-count="2">
  ```

### Distributed testing

- First, install Selenium Grid according to this [link](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/grid/getting_started/)
- Then config URL of hub into the configuration of browser as above. 
- For examlple:
  ```
   "remote": "http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"
  ```
